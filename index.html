                <h1>The History and Specifications of Pakistani Currency</h1>
                <p>As Pakistanis, we seldom ever wonder about the history of Pakistani currency or even notice the
                    various
                    depictions on the currency notes that we use daily. Moreover, we do not pay any particular attention
                    even when we sit down with our parents or grandparents and hear them talking about the days when
                    ‘ana’
                    and ‘paisa’ were all the rage. So, chances are that you might not be aware of the evolution that
                    Pakistani currency has gone through and why it is in the form it currently is.
                    A long list of thoughtful and consistent efforts have gone into shaping our currency notes and how
                    they
                    are printed. Even the coins we use have been through several iterations. Here, we’ll talk about the
                    history of Pakistani currency, all the way from 1947 to recent years. We’ll also share information
                    about
                    what is printed on the back of the currency notes and coins currently in circulation<b

                        sub-continent when Pakistan gained independence in 1947. Since Pakistan was a newly independent
                        nation, it was not possible to set up a central banking system in the country immediately.
                        Therefore, provisions were made for currency to be supplied to Pakistan after its establishment,
                        from the Reserve Bank of India.</p>

                        denominations of 5, 10 and 100 Rupee. The currency notes were printed by a British firm, Thomas
                        De
                        La Rue & Company. The 5-Rupee note of that time used to be blue,
                        the 10-Rupee one was reddish-orange, and the 100-Rupee note was dark green.... <a

                        were no longer appropriate and therefore, a new generation of Pakistani notes was designed
                        to be issued. The first note in this series was the 1-Rupee note, introduced in May of 1974.
                        It was blue in colour with writing in all four major regional languages. The back contained an
                        image of the Minar-e-Pakistan. This note was short lived due to its use of regional languages,
                        which could potentially create a divide among the people....<a

                        to 1960,
                        1 Pakistani Rupee used to have 16 ana in it, and each ana had 4 paisa in it, meaning each Rupee
                        had
                        64 paisa in it.
                        Accordingly, the coins in circulation were 1 paisa, 2 paisa, 1 ana, 2 ana, 4 ana, 8 ana, and
                        1-Rupee.</p>
                    <p class="currpara">After 1960, Pakistan adopted the metric system for its currency, and 1 Pakistani
                        Rupee then had 100
                        paisa in it. The coins of the time were 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 paisa. Most of these remained in
